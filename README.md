# SeatAllocator

SeatAllocator is a project designed to efficiently allocate seats for various scenarios such as exams, events, or classrooms. The repository provides algorithms and scripts to automate the seat allocation process, ensuring optimal distribution and minimal conflicts.

## Features

- **Automated Seat Allocation**: Assigns seats based on configurable rules.
- **Conflict Minimization**: Reduces the chances of seat assignment conflicts.
- **Customizable Inputs**: Supports various input formats for rooms, seats, and participants.
- **Scalable**: Suitable for small classrooms to large events.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rajkumar-2304/SeatAllocator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd SeatAllocator
   ```
3. Install dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   # Example for Python projects
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Modify the input files as per your seat allocation requirements. Run the main allocation script:

```bash
python allocate_seats.py
```

The output will be an allocation map showing which participant is assigned to which seat.

## Example

Suppose you have a list of students and a set of available seats. The script will output a mapping like:

| Student Name | Room | Seat Number |
|--------------|------|-------------|
| Alice        | A    | 1           |
| Bob          | A    | 2           |
| Carol        | B    | 1           |
